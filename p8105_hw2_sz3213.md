## Problem 1

Import and clean the data.

``` r
pols_month <-
  read_csv("mydata/pols-month.csv") |> 
  separate(mon, into = c("year", "month_num", "day"), sep = "-", convert = TRUE) |> 
  mutate(
    president = case_match(
      prez_gop,
      1 ~ "gop",
      2 ~ "gop",
      0 ~ "dem"),
    month = month.abb[month_num]) |> 
  select(year, month, everything(), -day, -month_num, -starts_with("prez"))
```

``` r
snp <-
  read_csv("mydata/snp.csv") |> 
  mutate(
    date_2 = mdy(date)) |> 
  separate(date_2, into = c("year", "month_num", "day"), sep = "-", convert = TRUE) |> 
  mutate(
    month = month.abb[month_num]) |> 
  relocate(year, month) |> 
  select(-date, -day, -month_num)
```

``` r
unemploy <-
  read_csv("mydata/unemployment.csv") |>
  pivot_longer(
    Jan:Dec,
    names_to = "month",
    values_to = "unemployment") |> 
  janitor::clean_names()
```

Merge the datasets.

``` r
results_538 <- 
  inner_join(pols_month, snp, by = c("year", "month")) |> 
  inner_join(unemploy, by = c("year", "month"))
```

The dataset `pols_month` gives information about the number of national
politicians who are Democratic or Republican between 1947 and 2015. It
contains 9 variables and 822 observations. The variables `gov_gop` ,
`sen_gop`, and `rep_gop` represent the number of Republican governors,
senators, and representatives on the associated date, respectively.
Similarly, `gov_dem`, `sen_dem`, and `rep_dem` represent the number of
Democratic governors, senators, and representatives, respectively. The
variable `president` indicates the president on the associated date was
republican or democratic.

The `snp` data contains measures of stock market monthly from 1969 to
2068 based on Standard & Poor’s stock market index (S&P). The `close`
variable indicates the closing values of the S&P stock index. The
dataset contains 3 variables and 787 observations.

The `unemploy` dataset contains 3 variables and 816 observations. It
measures the percentage of unemployment in the associated month between
1948 and 2015

The resulting dataframe `results_538` contains 558 observations on 11
variables, ranging from 1969 to 2015.

## Problem 2

The following codes import and clean the data collected by trash wheels.

``` r
Mr_tw <-
  read_excel("mydata/202309 Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx",
                     sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel",
                     range = "A2:N586") |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  separate(date, into = c("year_num", "month_num", "day"), sep = "-") |> 
  select(dumpster, year, month, everything(), -year_num, -month_num) |> 
  mutate(
    homes_powered = weight_tons * 500 / 30,
    year = as.numeric(year),
    trash_wheel_id = "Mr. Trash Wheel")
```

``` r
Prof_tw <-
  read_excel("mydata/202309 Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx",
                     sheet = "Professor Trash Wheel",
                     range = "A2:M108") |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  separate(date, into = c("year_num", "month_num", "day"), sep = "-") |> 
  select(dumpster, year, month, everything(), -year_num, -month_num) |> 
  mutate(
    homes_powered = weight_tons * 500 / 30, 
    trash_wheel_id = "Professor Trash Wheel"
  )
```

``` r
Gwynnda <-
  read_excel("mydata/202309 Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx",
                     sheet = "Gwynnda Trash Wheel",
                     range = "A2:L157") |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  separate(date, into = c("year_num", "month_num", "day"), sep = "-") |> 
  select(dumpster, year, month, everything(), -year_num, -month_num) |> 
  mutate(
    homes_powered = weight_tons * 500 / 30, 
    trash_wheel_id = "Gwynnda Trash Wheel"
  )
```

The three datasets were then merged.

``` r
trash_wheels <-
  bind_rows(Mr_tw, Prof_tw, Gwynnda) |> 
  select(dumpster, trash_wheel_id, everything())
```

The dataset `trash_wheels` contains data collected from three trash
wheels: Mr. Trash Wheel, Professor Trash Wheel, and Gwynnda Trash Wheel,
resulting in 15 variables and 845 observations. It contains dumpster
information, date of collection, total litter amount, and litter types.
The variable `homes_powered` was the number of homes that would be
powered if converting the total amount of litter to electricity.
Professor Trash Wheel collected a total amount of 216.26 tons of trash
from 2017 to 2023. Furthermore, according to the data, in July of 2021,
the total number of cigarette butts collected by Gwynnda Trash Wheel was
1.63^{4}.

## Problem 3

``` r
baseline <-
  read_csv("mydata/MCI_baseline.csv", skip = 1) |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  mutate(
    sex = case_match(
      sex, 
      0 ~ "male",
      1 ~ "female"),
    apoe4 = case_match(
      apoe4,
      0 ~ "non-carrier",
      1 ~ "carrier"),
    age_at_onset_num = as.numeric(age_at_onset),
    age_diff = age_at_onset_num - current_age) |> 
  filter(age_diff >= 0 | is.na(age_diff)) |> 
  select(-age_at_onset, -age_diff)
```

The original dataset includes information for 480 participants, and
among those 480 participants, 480 developed MCI. The data includes 6
variables, providing information about participants’ ID, age, sex, years
of education, APOE4 carrier status, and age at MCI onset. The original
`age_at_onset` variable was converted to `age_at_onset_num` which
contains numerical values. During the data processing, the `sex` and
`apoe4` variables, which were binary, were modified into character
variables `male` vs. `female` and `carrier` vs. `non-carrier`,
respectively. Three participants who have developed MCI predate the
baseline were excluded from the subsequent analysis.

The average baseline age of all participants is 65.03, and 16.875% of
women in the study are APOE4 carriers.

``` r
amyloid <-
  read_csv("mydata/mci_amyloid.csv", skip = 1) |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  mutate(
    across(
      c(baseline, time_2, time_4, time_6, time_8), ~na_if(., "Na"))) |> 
  mutate_at(c("baseline", "time_2", "time_4", "time_8"), as.numeric)

  
```

The amyloid $\beta$ 42/40 ratio is used for diagnosing and predicting
Alzheimer’s disease outcomes. The dataset `amyloid` contains 6
observations and 487 variables, recording $\beta$ 42/40 ratio measured
with 2-year intervals from the baseline. During the data processing, all
the missing values were converted to `NA`, and all $\beta$ 42/40 ratio
measures were converted to numeric values.

``` r
mci_baseline_only <- 
  anti_join(baseline, amyloid, c('id'='study_id'))

mci_amyloid_only <- 
  anti_join(amyloid, baseline, c('study_id'='id'))

mci_both <-
  inner_join(baseline, amyloid, c('id'='study_id'))

write_csv(mci_both, "mydata/mci_cleaned.csv")
```

There are 8 participants who appear only in the `baseline` dataset and
15 participants appear only in the `amyloid` dataset. The combined
dataset `mci_both` contains only participants who appear in both
datasets, resulting in 472 observations on 11 variables. The resulting
dataframe stores basic information about participants, such as age, sex,
years of education, APOE4 carrier status, and age at MCI onset; it also
recorded the $\beta$ 42/40 ratio for participants, measured in 2-year
time intervals starting from the baseline. The average $\beta$ 42/40
ratio at baseline for APOE4 carriers is 0.1085.
